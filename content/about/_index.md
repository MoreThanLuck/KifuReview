The Kifu Review is a online-focused literary journal for the digital age. We hope to build a home and community around writers of fiction on the bleeding edge, with a focus on craft.

## Name—
Kifu is the reading for two Japanese words, of which both are relevant—

(棋譜) - the Japanese term for a game record for a game of Go or shogi.

(棊布) - scattering (e.g. of islands, Go pieces, etc., often in a harmonious balance); dispersal; constellation; irregular spread.

Writing, on both the macro and micro levels, is a constellation. It's the connection of various ideas, images, words, and feelings, into something greater than the sum of its parts. The same goes for us writers, often isolated, and yet able to be brought together to help convey meaning to our writing through mutual reading and curation.

The Kifu Review is not based around a city or a university as was the norm before, but instead interconnected and dispersed as the internet allows us to be.

## The Kifu Review has a few goals—

1. To curate and share the best fiction we can, for free, in a digital-focused publication, quarterly.
2. To build a platform for bold, evocative, visceral, and nuanced writing in a way that is sustainable and beneficial for writers.
3. To focus on craft, so that writers of all stripes and skillsets can improve and make better art.

At present, The Kifu Review is a volunteer publication. I am exploring different financing and funding strategies to make something to compensate writers and readers and editors fairly for their work. As a result of this, there are currently no fees associated with submission.

## Submission—

The Kifu Review has open submissions for our quarterly publication schedule. Here's what we're looking for—

We want fiction on the bleeding edge. We're not a genre-based publication, but won't shy away from shades of fantasy or science-fiction; think Ted Chiang or Kazuo Ishiguro.

- Fiction up to 8,000 words, though around 4,000 words or less is preferred. 
- We publish writing in English, or translated to English.
- For works in translation, permission from the original author is required before publication.
- We are certainly happy to consider simultaneous submissions, but please notify us if your work has been accepted elsewhere.
- We are genre-agnostic: good work is good work. Send us your best.
- Novel excerpts are discouraged but accepted, so long as the submission stands on it's own.
- No gore.

Send submissions as attached documents (txt, md, or doc, pls!) to—
