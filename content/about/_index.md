The Kifu Review is a online-focused literary journal for the digital age. We hope to build a home and community around writers of fiction on the bleeding edge, with a focus on craft.

## Name—
Kifu is the reading for two Japanese words, of which both are relevant—

(棋譜) - the Japanese term for a game record for a game of Go or shogi.
(棊布) - scattering (e.g. of islands, Go pieces, etc., often in a harmonious balance); dispersal; constellation; irregular spread.

Writing on both the macro and micro levels, is a constellation. It's the connection of various ideas, images, words, and feelings, into something greater than the sum of its parts. So to are us writers, often isolated, and yet able to be brought together to help convey meaning to our writing through mutual reading and curation.

We are not based around a city or a university as was the norm before, but instead interconnected and dispersed as the internet allows us to be.

## We have a few goals—

1. To curate and share the best fiction we can, for free, in a digital-focused publication, quarterly.
2. To build a platform for the bold, weird, visceral, and evocative writing in a way that is sustainable and beneficial for writers.
3. To focus on craft, so that writers of all stripes and skillsets can improve and make better art.

At present, The Kifu Review is a volunteer publication. I am exploring different financing and funding strategies to make something to compensate writers and readers and editors fairly for their work. As a result of this, there are currently no fees associated with submission.

## Submission—

- For works in translation, permission from the original author is required before publication.
